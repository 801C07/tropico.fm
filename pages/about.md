# What is Tropico FM?

KFFI 103.1 Tropico FM is dedicated to serving Idaho’s Latin American & BIPOC communities. Our frequency is lent to local musicians, artists, activists. We bring the vibrant sounds of the Caribbean, Latin America, and the African Diaspora to our listeners, while also shining a spotlight on local community events. Our mission is to celebrate and uplift diverse voices through music and meaningful engagement, fostering a stronger, more connected community.

## Why independent media?

Radio is the truest form of independent media. In today’s 24 hour news cycle world where major media conglomerates consider unbiased reporting to be simply giving equal airtime to both conservative & liberal talking heads, independent radio stations are increasingly viewed as the most trustworthy news source. That community trust goes a long way in empowering the communities in which independent radio stations operate. Community stations should spread goodwill, further to improve their community, and share information. They should only air news segments sourced from reputable media outlets. Community radio stations play a pivotal role in relaying localized information including news, sports, and weather forecasts that pertain to a single town or city. Community radio helps disseminate local information to people in a clear and informative manner.

## Community Driven

Perhaps the most empowering aspect about community radio is the exposure that it can lend to local artists. Community radio stations play a critical role in providing local musicians with exposure to their communities, who can then share their content and help to grow their popularity and follower engagement. Radio stations provide a valuable marketing tool with targeted reach capabilities. Community radio attracts an organic audience.
