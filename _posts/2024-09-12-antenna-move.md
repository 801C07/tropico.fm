            We moved our antenna and transmitter to the top of Table Rock, greatly expanding our reach throughout the Treasure Valley on 103.1 FM!! Thanks to everyone who has supported us so far in this journey to be the newest noncommercial radio station in Boise! Our 103.1 FM frequency now reaches as far west as Wilder, ID!
