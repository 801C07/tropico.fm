For Treefort’s 10th anniversary, Tropico FM has a specially curated art & music showcase. Taking place March 26th at the Basque Center, Irvin Brown (Bahamas) makes a triumphant return to the stage, starting out the night with his live band.

Later in the evening Rio based Ricardo Richard will make his Treefort debut playing what he calls ‘industrial tropicalia.” Finally, the headlining set will be played by thrilling psychedelic afro-latin rockers Zeta (Venezuela). In addition we have four local Boise Latino artists exhibiting their work all night.
