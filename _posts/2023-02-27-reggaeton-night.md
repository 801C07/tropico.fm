| ![](/assets/img/posts/reggaeton.jpeg) | TROPICO FM PRESENTS: <br> Reggaeton Night <br> March 18th <br>|

Tropico FM partnered with 208 Fresh Ent to throw our first ever reggaeton party at the Neurolux in downtown Boise! It was a grand success, we packed the place with a sold out crowd.

K-schef and DJ Fresh 208 brought down the house playing reggaeton, cumbia, dembow, hip hop and more. People from all over the Treasure Valley turned out to dance, party and socialize. Downtown Boise needs more spaces for black and brown people - viva la raza! We will be throwing shows like this once a month going forward. Tropico FM will be back with another reggaeton night on March 18th - see you there!
