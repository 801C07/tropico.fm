# Treefort 9 was a blast!

We debuted our art/music showcase for the first time at the Basque Center. Grupo Adiktos absolutely tore up the place with a double header set & closing the night out was local cumbia legend Lobo Lara.

Orchestra Gold absolutely stole the night with their West African based funk

Art from local Latinos like Sara Esquivel & Carly Jackson decked out the side of the venue for the whole night, capturing the eyes of every person that walked by. MC Irvin Brown was our guide for the night and did an excellent job hosting all the bands.

We are very excited to be back in â€™22 for another showcase!
