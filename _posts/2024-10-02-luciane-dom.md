            Luciane Dom, multilingual singer, songwriter and producer, is part of the new generation of contemporary artists from Rio de Janeiro who bring poetic themes such as Black diaspora, feminism, empowerment, and social reflections that impact the construction of their emotions. Luciane´s performances incorporate various musical influences: from Afrobeat, to Urban Jazz, Reggae, and Ijexá, and are calls to action, inviting audiences to dance, sing, and free their bodies. She has been featured at venues such as Brasil Summerfest at Lincoln Center, and was named Rising Star of the Year by the 2022 African Entertainment Awards.

            Possessing a History degree from the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, in addition to songwriting workshops, Luciane´s multilingual educational work primarily revolves around masterclasses with a focus on the Afro-Brazilian Candomblé and interactive classes covering traditional Brazilian rhythms including Samba, Bossa Nova, Forró, Axé, and Maracatu.
