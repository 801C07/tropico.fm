| ![](/assets/img/music/irvin.brown/img/portrait.jpg) | Born in Freeport, Grand Bahama, Irvin Brown is a Bahamian rapper, singer, producer, and songwriter. While heavily influenced by his Caribbean background, he's always open to exploring new genres of music, and incorporating them into his own style. As a UWC alumni, his commitment to music runs deeper than the love of the sound itself, as he also desires to become an icon for his country.|
