From the swirling guitars of shoegaze, to the swaying melodies of boleros, this show is a genre-fluid mix of contemporary music and the classics that may have inspired them. Expect connections, surprises and an intersectional perspective on the music that shapes our culture sin fronteras.

Listen live every 2nd & 4th Saturday from 11 AM - 1 PM. Your Host, Chabela, is a first generation American with roots in Michoac√°n, MX
