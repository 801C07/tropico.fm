We all about it all over here! From oldies going way back to the 1920’s, to modern music through 2025; ranging from Latin music to disco, indie, rock, pop, hip hop, reggaeton, you name it, I play it! Growing up with a big family from Mexico, Spain and the States, I was always listening to a healthy plethora of genres from the many personalities in my family. I’m here to bring all the vibes! It’s all love here, so sit back and relax and enjoy the insight of the many multiple beautiful generations I hold near and dear to my heart.
