Steve Castillo AKA DJ Alex 1 is Latin-American and influenced by Willie Colon, Celia Cruz, Marc Anthony and many more musicians. Music is his life. He worked as a lighting and audio designer for 24 plus years. This allowed him to travel to Central, South, and Latin America, Mexico and the US. Now he lives in the Treasure Valley and is very excited about his next chapter.
