Tune into Indigo Rhythm every other Tuesday 5-7pm with OsmiaEvolet as she journeys through the sounds, textures, and polyrhythms of Afro-Latin, jazz, neo soul, funk, experimental, and electronic origins. OsmiaEvolet is a music producer and DJ from Boise. Her artist name comes from her passion and curiosity for the natural world. It combines Osmia (a solitary bee genus) and Evolet (meaning the love, to live, to breathe, Violet).
