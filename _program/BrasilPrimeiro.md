Brasil Primeiro is Tropico FMâ€™s new Brazilian Music show. Hosted by Brazilian singer, composer and producer Rodrigo Thuja, the show airs every Sunday from 12 to 2 PM covering traditional and modern music made in the most culturally rich regions of Brasil, the Northeast and the North. With a passionate approach to cultural origins and decolonization, Rodrigo starts our musical journey from the magical northeastern state of Bahia, his homeland and home to the first capital of the country, Salvador. Birthplace to Samba and to many of the most iconic names of Brazilian
Music, such as Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, Bahia is a diverse melting pot of tradition and culture that has created a strong foundation to birth some of the greatest and most soulful music in the world.
