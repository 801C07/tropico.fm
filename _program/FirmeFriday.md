Maestra Mo (AKA in real life as Monique Michel) originally hails from Los Angeles, California and moved to Idaho long before it was cool or trendy. She can be heard online on Fridays from 1-3 PM playing her favorite Old School, Hip Hop, R and B Rap, Cumbias, 70’s jazz and everything in between. Having grown up in her dad’s music store, Muzik Cellar, formerly located in Pico Rivera, she learned quickly about the many genres of music and the feelings that can be evoked from a single song. Aside from working and pending time at the record store, Maestra Mo also spent the weekends selling records and cassettes at the Paramount Swap Meet at-you guessed it- her dad’s record stand… (Shout out to Space F-120!) Over the years her love for music and all things musical has grown to a vast appreciation of multiple genres, but her first love will always be disco. Talk about if ya know, ya know. �� Maestra Mo is a former music teacher, and now concentrates solely on her first love: folklorico dancing, and being the director of her own company, the Ballet Folklorico Mexico Lindo. On any given day she can be found dancing and listening to music of some sort with her trusty German Shepherd, Pirate.
