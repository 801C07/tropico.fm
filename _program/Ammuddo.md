Join Hunter Levy as he scours the world of music and poetry across the world on Ammuddo. The show's name comes from the Tamazight word for "the journey," a language of the native peoples of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco where Hunter lived for two years, and it is a journey Hunter takes listeners on each episode as he dives into the music, poetry, and culture of a specific country or region. Marhaba—welcome—to Ammuddo.
