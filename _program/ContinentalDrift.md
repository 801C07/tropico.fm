Boise native Jordan Unger, aka Nug Vegas, has been keeping a keen ear out and diligently listening to a wide variety of music since his early teens. He started to develop an appreciation for an eclectic array of music by swapping weekly burned CDs with friends and perusing the newly burgeoning scene of online music blogs. From there his devotion only grew stronger as he started to grow a record collection and online music became more and more accessible. A string of international travel throughout his 20’s – from places ranging to Latin America to Europe to North Africa – enhanced his appreciation for global grooves. It is in this light that Nug Vegas joined Tropico FM, deciding to call his show “Continental Drift” – a nod to the ethereal mix of blends from around the world featured on his show.
