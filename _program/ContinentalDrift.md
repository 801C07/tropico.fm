A nod to the ethereal mix of blends from around the world featured on his show. Growing up, Nug Vegas began to develop an appreciation for an eclectic array of music by swapping weekly burned CDs with friends and perusing the newly burgeoning scene of online music blogs. From there his devotion only grew stronger as he started to grow a record collection and online music became increasingly accessible. A string of international travel in his 20â€™s - from places ranging from Latin America to North Africa - enhanced his appreciation for global grooves. It is in this light that Nug Vegas joined Tropico FM!
