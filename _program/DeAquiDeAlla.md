Join Mija every other Wednesday for, De aquí y de allá, a show that plays bilingual music from different generations and genres of Latinx artists ranging from reggaeton, cumbia, indie music and Spanish throwbacks. Meaning, "from here and from there," the show is a space to reclaim a feeling of belonging in Idaho and reflect the diversity of the Latinx community.
