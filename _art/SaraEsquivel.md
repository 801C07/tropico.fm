# Sara Esquivel

| :--- | ---: |
| ![](/assets/img/art/sara.esquivel/img/portrait.jpg) | Ms. Esquivel was born in Caldwell, ID in 1976 and has lived in the Treasure Valley most of her life. Her studio is currently located in Boise. Sara prides herself on being mostly self-taught and embracing the outsider paradigm while also absorbing technique from more formal settings like classwork at BSU and working with individual mentors.|

She has been privileged to have installations shown at Idaho Historical Society exhibits and Nampa’s 2018 Dia de Muertos celebration. Ms. Esquivel has lectured on embroidery through the Treasure Valley Artist’s Alliance and is an archivist at Ming Gallery in Boise.
