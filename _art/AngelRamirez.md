# Air Theurgy

| :--- | ---: |
| ![](/assets/img/art/angel.ramirez/img/portrait.jpg) | Air Theurgy is a name created for my work to be portrayed as. I chose Air Theurgy because A.I.R. is my initials and theurgy means the practice of rituals, sometimes seen as magical in nature. |

I consider macrame a ritually bring a broken piece of wood or driftwood back to life and give it use (life) again; thatâ€™s why theurgy was chosen.
Using something that can be considered dead or useless and giving life and meaning in an artistic way describes some emotions which are indescribable but can be shown in macrame.
